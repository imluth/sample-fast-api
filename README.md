# Sample FastAPI application

This demo FastAPI application I have created just to learn how API works and basic python. This API service will include endpoint "http://127.0.0.1:8000/random" which will send back a random numbers between 1 to 100.


## Installation

Use the docker compose to run it.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Output

```
$ docker compose up --build
